            <h3>What is ATM about</h3>
            <p>ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet. It's a program for middle schoolers. It's a three year program. Student's 6th-8th learn new way of using a computer or other apps. For example coding. A lot of kids in Bancroft Middle School do applied magnet technology. Here is a link to my teacher Miss. Milton website about ATM. The link is in All About ATM! Enjoy.</p>

            <p> I feel that when I first started this great program it got very confusing for me but I think when Miss. Milton and Miss. McClure started teaching I got less confused and my favorite program was sketchup because we could make buildings and other stuff like chairs, lamps, and beds it was my favorite. I feel when I get older I will remember the things that I learned in ATM .ATM is a great program that will help me throughout life. I hope to learn more things later in the future of ATM!</p>
