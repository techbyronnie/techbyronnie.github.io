            <h3>What is ATM about</h3>
            <p>ATM stands for Applied Technology Magnet. It's a progam for middle schoolers. It's a three year program. Student's 6th-8th learn new way of using a computer or other apps.

            <h3>Reflection of ATM</h3>
            <p> I feel that when I first started this great progam it got very confusing for me but I think when Miss. Milton and Miss. McClure started teaching I got less confused and my favorite program was sketchup because we could make buildings and other stuff like chairs, lamps, and beds it was my favorite. ATM is a great program that will help me throughout life. I hope to learn more things later int he future of ATM. </p>
