                            <p> The high school that I am going to attend is LakeWood. I chose it because it has a great ATM program. That I will like to attend and also if I do not get chosen to an the ATM program there I was go for another elective that will help me become a lawyer. But there is other high school's that I am thinking of trying to attend to. But my brother goes to LakeWood and my mom went there too so I am most likely to go there too. </p>

                            <p>The college that I am trying to attend to is Harvard Law School. I think it is the best suite for me because I want to be a Lawyer in the future. I think that going to Harvard Law School will help me make my dream come true. 92% of people that went to Harvard become Lawyer's and I am willing to do anything that we make me go to that great school!</p>

                            <p>My Career interests is for me to become a lawyer. I feel that it’s a right fit for me, because I don’t see myself doing anything else. I want to become a Prosecutor, not a defendant. Being a Prosecutor is when you are not defending the person in court it is when you are against them. But If I do not become a Lawyer. I can always be a judge. But being a Lawyer is my dream. </p>
                <h3>Goals!</h3>
                <p>My goals are for me to graduate high school and go to Harvard Law School. To achieve my dream to become and Lawyer. One of my other goals is to live in New York and have a house there. I'm would love to live in New York because there is more crime there. Also I like living in Cities!</p>
